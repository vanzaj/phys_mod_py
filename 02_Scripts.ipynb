Second, you have to \"tell\" Python to reload your code (look for `reload()` or `%autoreload` documentation). If you're using IPython notebook, don't forget to \"Run\" the cell to make it's content available in other cells.\n",

Then run your script and confirm that you get what you expect. Python comes with a few built-in functions and a huge number of functions available in modules. It is easy to write a script that has the same name as an existing function, and if you are not careful, you might find yourself running an existing function instead of your script. There is a concept of namespaces in Python that helps to avoid \"name collisions\", but it's still your responsibility to make sure they don't happen.\n",
